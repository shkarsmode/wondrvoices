    <h2>💛 Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Most people don’t expect to face cancer. And when they do, many are met with silence not because others don’t
        care, but because they don’t know what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
        WondrSpots offer a simple but tangible way to respond. By putting out blank cards, they invite people to pause
        and create something meaningful: a message of care, a drawing, a few kind words.
    </p>
    <p>
        These cards become voices that might otherwise go unspoken. Each WondrSpot carries the unique spirit of its
        setting, a reminder that kindness can come from anywhere, and that we’re all connected.
    </p>
    <p>
        For some spaces, it’s a quiet corner of compassion. Others turn it into a shared moment of creativity and
        connection. Either way, it becomes the part of your space that outlives a visit.
