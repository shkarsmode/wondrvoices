    <h2>Become a WondrSpot</h2>
    <p>
        WondrSpots are spaces such as libraries, clinics, coffee shops, classrooms, community centers,
        or kitchen tables where kindness takes shape. They are places where anyone can pause, reflect,
        and create something meaningful for someone facing cancer or serious illness.
    </p>
    <p>
        By becoming a WondrSpot, you’re helping turn your community into a wellspring of compassion, creativity,
        and connection. Whether you host a one-time letter-writing event or set up a permanent card-making station,
        you're offering something rare and needed: a moment of care from one human to another.
    </p>

    <h3>What You’re Creating</h3>
    <p>When someone sits down at a WondrSpot, they’re reminded:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>You are not alone.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Your words matter.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Even small acts can ripple outward.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Each card or artwork created will be anonymously delivered to someone navigating a serious diagnosis.
        These messages often go to hospitals, cancer centers, or hospice programs, offering comfort in a moment
        of uncertainty.
